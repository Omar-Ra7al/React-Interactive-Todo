# React Interactive To-Do List

This project is a fully responsive and interactive To-Do List application built using React. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks. It also includes a light and dark mode for better user experience.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** Smooth transitions and animations for an enhanced user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile and desktop views.
- **Light & Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Update existing tasks easily.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.

## React Features

- **useReducer:** Manages complex state logic across the app, particularly for handling to-do actions like adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
- **useContext:** Provides global state management, allowing different components to access and modify the state without prop drilling.
- **useState:** Manages local component state, such as input values for task creation and editing.
- **useEffect:** Handles side effects, such as fetching data or interacting with the browser's API.
- **Custom Context Provider:** A custom provider wraps the app and makes the to-do state and dispatch functions available throughout the component tree.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS:** Custom styles with animations and transitions.
- **Netlify:** Hosting and deployment platform for web projects.
